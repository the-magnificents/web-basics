# Web basics
## Motivation
Web technologies are everywhere in the python ecosystem, specially behind the interactive computing technologies like jupyter lab, jupyter hub and jupyter notebooks, dask, bokhe. Basic literacy on how the web works and some if its underlying concepts is important to be able to propose, design and develop solutions relevant to our research community.

## Some examples and materials where we will explore:
- **Basic concepts:** Resources and representations 
- **The browser environment and its developer tools**
- **Basic HTML5:** Making a proto jupyter notebook with pure javascript
- **Javascript frameworks:** Exploring Vuejs
- **Web APIs:** A simple node server that serves an API made of JSON files

## Glosary
**http**: The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.

**http requests** HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as HTTP verbs. [Read more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)

**html**:The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.[Read more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)

**Markup language** In computer text processing, a markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, meaning when the document is processed for display, the markup language is not shown, and is only used to format the text. Some markup languages, such as the widely used HTML, have pre-defined presentation semanticsâ€”meaning that their specification prescribes some aspects of how to present the structured data on particular media.

**ftp**: The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP is built on a client-server model architecture using separate control and data connections between the client and the server.

**Difference between ftp and HTTP**: The basic difference between HTTP and FTP is that HTTP is used to access different websites on the internet. ... HTTP is efficient to transfer smaller files like web pages whereas, FTP is efficient to transfer large files. HTTP does not require authentication whereas, FTP uses the password for authentication.

**Resource** A web resource, or simply resource, is any identifiable thing, whether digital, physical, or abstract. Resources are identified using Uniform Resource Identifiers. In the Semantic Web, web resources and their semantic properties are described using the Resource Description Framework.[Read more...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_resource#:~:text=A%20web%20resource%2C%20or%20simply,using%20the%20Resource%20Description%20Framework.)

**API** In computing, an application programming interface (API) is an interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.

**Web API**: 
A Web API is an application programming interface for either a web server or a web browser. It is a web development concept, usually limited to a web application's client-side (including any web frameworks being used), and thus usually does not include web server or browser implementation details such as SAPIs or APIs unless publicly accessible by a remote web application.
