# Key points on Vuejs
## JavaScript framework
> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
A JavaScript framework is an application framework written in JavaScript. It differs from a JavaScript library in its control flow:[1] A library offers functions to be called by its parent code, whereas a framework defines the entire application design.[2] A developer does not call a framework; instead, the framework calls and uses the code in some particular way. Some JavaScript frameworks follow the model–view–controller paradigm designed to segregate a web application into orthogonal units to improve code quality and maintainability. Examples include AngularJS, Ember.js, Meteor.js, and Vue.js.


the "progressive" means its implemented as additional markup to html. it basically a template model bound to a data model. if the model is updated the browsers html is updated, that is it reacts to model updates.

it approach is similar to react, but its a template based view engine as opposed to react's component based view engine.
